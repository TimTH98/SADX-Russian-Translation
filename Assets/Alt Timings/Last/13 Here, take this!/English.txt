Hey, Sonic!
Amy!
Here, take this!
Hey guys, what's up?
Chaos only used the negative power \nof the Emeralds.
Sonic, you should be able to \nharness their real power!
As much as I hate to admit it, \nI think Tails is right about this!
Negative forces aren't the only way to\nempower the Chaos Emeralds.
Our positive feelings toward \neach other can make them work.
Our hearts together form awesome \npower.
