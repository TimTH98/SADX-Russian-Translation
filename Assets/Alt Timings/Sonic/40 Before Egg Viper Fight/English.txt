Damn you, Sonic!
How dare you always, always,\nalways, always stand in my way!
And this time...
You destroyed the Egg Carrier...
You defeated Chaos...
Not to mention you're even\nleading my base to ruin...!
If that's how it is,\nI'll show you the ace up my sleeve!
You're finished this time,\nSonic!
I'll make you realize this time.
That no matter how many times\nyou try, NO WAY! You will always fail.
