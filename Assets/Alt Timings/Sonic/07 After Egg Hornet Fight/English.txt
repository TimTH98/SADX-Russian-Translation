Well, that wasn't so hard!
AHA!
Come on Chaos, time to eat!
Chaos?
Oh no, isn't that the same monster
I saw the other day...
Ooooh Yes!   It's just as \nthe stone tablets predicted.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
His strength increases every time\nI feed him a Chaos Emerald! 
With all 7 Emeralds in him, \nhe'll be invincible!
And work for me!
Together, we'll destroy \nStation Square!
And on its ruins, I'll build \nRobotnikland, the ultimate city!
Where I will rule it all!
Come on Chaos!   Let's find \nanother Emerald, shall we?
Sonic!
We can't let him get away \nwith this.   Can we?
No way, Tails!
Without more Emeralds, \nthe monster can't transform, so...
It's up to us to get the Emeralds\nbefore Eggman does, huh?
