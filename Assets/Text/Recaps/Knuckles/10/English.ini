Text=	I'm Knuckles the Echidna.\n	But just call me Knuckles.\n	I finally returned from a strange\n	world. I am still missing some pieces.\n	I saw a reflection of the Egg Carrier\n	in the Master Emerald...\n	Is it revealing the location of\n	the missing fragments?\n	If I follow Eggman's robot, it should\n	lead me to the Egg Carrier. Let's go!
