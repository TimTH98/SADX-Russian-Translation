Text=	I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!\n	Tails and I jumped into my plane,\n	and flew after Eggman.\n	But the Egg Carrier attacked us.\n	The Tornado was damaged\n	and we crash landed...\n\n	I landed in Station Square.\n	I think that's when I got seperated\n	from Tails.  I'm sure he'll be OK\n	by himself, but maybe I should go\n	and find him anyway.
