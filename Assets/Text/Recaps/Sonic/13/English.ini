Sonic the Hedgehog!\n	Amy was taken away, so I went\n	down to Mystic Ruins.\n	And what I saw there was...\n	the Egg Carrier!\n	It flew off towards the mountains...\n	with Amy trapped inside!\n	Now the Tornado is damaged.\n	Oh, what should I do?\n	Well, I still have my super fast feet!\n	I'll chase after the Egg Carrier\n	and catch up with it\n	on the other side of this mountain!
