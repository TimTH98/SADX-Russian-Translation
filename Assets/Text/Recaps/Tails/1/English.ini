Text=	I'm Miles "Tails" Prower.\n	But you can call me "Tails"!\n	The other day I took my new airplane,\n	the one that's powered by a Chaos Emerald,\n	for a test flight, but it crashed!\n	To my surprise, Sonic came to\n	rescue me.  He's my hero!\n	I invited him to my workshop\n	located in the Mystic Ruins. He should be\n	really impressed!
