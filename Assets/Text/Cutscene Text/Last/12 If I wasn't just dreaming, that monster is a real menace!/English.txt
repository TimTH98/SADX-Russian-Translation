If I wasn't just dreaming, \nthat monster is a real menace!
Eggman!
Looks like he's after Chaos, too!
This Egg Carrier 2 was made because\nsomething like this could happen.
You have defied your master,\nstupid beast.
Now you must be destroyed \nat all costs!
Aaaaahhhhh!
I've had enough!  \nWho do you think you are, anyway?
Oh, it's you!
The one... who sealed Chaos... \nin the Master Emerald!
Tikal!
My heart has always been in the \nMaster Emerald, along with Chaos'.
Now he's filled with anger and sadness.
And if it goes on, he'll eventually \ndestroy the world, like he did before!
Look!  \nHe's absorbed the Emerald's power!
He must be sealed in\nthe Master Emerald, NOW!
How can that help?
It won't change how he feels inside, \nwill it?
His heart will still remain in turmoil \nand his anger just won't vanish!
He'll just be trapped forever!
What choice do we have?
