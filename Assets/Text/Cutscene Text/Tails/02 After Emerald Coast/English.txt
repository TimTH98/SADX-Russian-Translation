Boy, you're lucky \nI saw you come down!
So, what went wrong, anyway?
It's not like you \nto crash like that.
Yeah, it's just that I'm testing\na new prototype power supply,
and it's not fully compatible\nyet!
You can always borrow my plane,\nthe Tornado, if you want.
Thanks, Sonic.
But if I can make this work,\nit'll run circles around yours.
Check out this power supply!
It's a Chaos Emerald!   \nNo way!
I was lucky to find \none of the 7 Chaos Emeralds.
They have unlimited mystic\npowers.
Now I want to harness \nthat power to fly my plane.
Let's go to my workshop \nin the Mystic Ruins,
and I'll show you \nwhat I've been working on.
We'll go to the station,
hop on a train\nand get there in no time!
