	The servers are \nthe 7 Chaos Emeralds.
Hello there, friend. \nHow are you?
Umm... What were you saying\nbefore?
Huh?
It's something \nmy grandmother taught me.
I'm never to forget it.   \nIt goes like this...
	'The servers are the 7 Chaos.'
	'Chaos is power... \n	Power enriched by the heart.'
	'The controller is the one \n	that unifies the Chaos.'
But I'm still not sure \nwhat it all means.
But the number 7...
Is the same as the number of\nEmeralds there are.
Emeralds?
Forgive me, but I don't think\nwe've ever met before...
I'm Tikal...   And you are?
