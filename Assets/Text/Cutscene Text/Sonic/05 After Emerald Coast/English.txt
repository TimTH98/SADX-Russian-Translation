Hey Sonic.  \nLong time no see, huh?
I'm just glad you're okay.
What happened, anyway?
You're too good of a pilot \nto just crash like that.
That was a test run using \na new prototype propulsion system.
It's got a few bugs to iron out.
Why not just use my plane, \nthe Tornado?
Thanks, but you gotta check out\nmy newest power supply!
Ta dahhh!
WHOA!   \nA Chaos Emerald!
Yep! I just happened to find \none of the 7 Emeralds
during one of my test flights. 
This thing's got unlimited power,\nya know...
So I figured, why not use it \nto power my plane. Super charged!
You gotta come over to \nmy workshop, Sonic!
I've got something I've gotta \nshow you!
It's in the Mystic Ruins.   \nThe fastest way is by train.
Let's go!
