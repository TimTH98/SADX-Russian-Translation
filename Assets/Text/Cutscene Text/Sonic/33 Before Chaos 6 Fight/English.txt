Oh no!  Not again!
Chaos!   \nCould this be the same beast?
Ha ha ha ha ha! 
Oh, yes!  \nAttack Sonic, now!
Froggy!
I must save Froggy!
If he's your friend, \nI'll help you.
Just leave it to me!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Now I have 6 of \nthe Chaos Emeralds.
There's only one more \nleft to find.
I even found \nChaos' missing tail!
You won't get away \nwith this, you madman!
I will!
You're no match for Chaos - even\nthough he's not perfected yet.
Okay Chaos! Destroy them all...\nImmediately!
