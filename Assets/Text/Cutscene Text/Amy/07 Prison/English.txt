What do you want?
Hand me the bird.
Nope!
Quietly hand over the bird.
NO!   Never!
Why not?
I don't need to tell you anything.
You tell ME why you want it, now!
Does not compute.
You don't even know?
I know you might hurt us both.
Please, Mr. Robot...
Won't you help us, please?
Insufficient data.
You have feelings for something \nyou know nothing about.
Illogical!
I pity you.
Love is not part of your programming, \nyou are missing something good.
Hey birdie!   Come back here!
Go, escape!
Wh-what?
You sure?
It's dangerous here.
Hurry.  We'll be at \nthe Mystic Ruins base soon.
You're really nice.
You're different from the other robots.
You've got a soft spot \ninside your metal frame.
If you want, \nwe can be friends, okay?
