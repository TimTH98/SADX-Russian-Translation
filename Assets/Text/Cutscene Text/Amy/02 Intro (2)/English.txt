What's that?
Ahhh!   Watch it, watch it!
Ow!  You should watch \nwhere you're going, buddy!
Hey.  Are you alright? \nYou look kinda hurt.
What's this?
Huh...  Uh oh.
Yikes!  \nYou almost ran me over, creep!
Oh no!  Let's get out of here!
That was one of Eggman's robots, huh?
He must have captured you,\nand somehow you got away, right?
Don't worry, I'll protect you!
I'll do my best to keep us both from \nharm.  I'll stand by you all the way!
