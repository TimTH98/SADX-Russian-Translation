No!  Don't go any closer!
I'm sorry, I see you must not be \none of them, huh?
Did you notice the presence \nguarding these children?
He's a very loving \nand gentle creature.
These little creatures are too \nvulnerable without its protection.
This protection allows them \nto continue singing in peace.
Even I was surprised the first time \nI saw him.
Now my father is trying \nto take their sacred home.
It seems his heart is closed off \nto us all.
My true hope is that some day, \nwe'll understand each other.
