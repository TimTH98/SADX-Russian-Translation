Gee, I'm bored.
Every day's the same old thing...
Same place, different day...
I miss the good old days.
Hangin' out with my hero, Sonic...
Chasing bad guys...
And blowing them away - ha hah!
But now he's gone.\nAnd there's nothing left to do,
but shop 'til I drop.\nThere was always something fun to do
with Sonic around. \nI really miss him.
Hey, what's going on here?\nIs there an eclipse today, or what?
Nobody forecast a storm or anything...
