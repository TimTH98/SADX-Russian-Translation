Please stop!
Amy!
That's one of Eggman's clunkers.\nOutta my way!
No!
He helped me before \nby letting me escape.
This robot is different!
You don't need to hurt him, okay?
Amyâ€¦
Okay, I guess I'll let him go, then.
The Egg Carrier's losing altitude!
We're fresh outta time!\nTake Amy and clear out, fast!
What about you?
I'll nail that Eggman!\nCan't let him escape!
I knew you would save me, Sonic.\nYou're my hero!
Uhhh, you okay?
It's dangerous here.
Don't pay attention to Eggman\nanymore. Free yourself. Come on!
Why are you helping me?
I said we'd be friends\nand I'm returning your favor.
Even this birdie wants you \nto be free.
Eggman's not the kind of man\nyou should work for.
Amy, come on!  Let's get going!
Until we meet again, Mr. Robot!\nTake care of yourself!
