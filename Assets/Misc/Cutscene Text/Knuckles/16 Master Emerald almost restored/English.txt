What... I'm back in front of\nthe altar!
This is beginning to blow\nmy mind!
Wait a minute... \nI remember...
The broken pieces of \nthe Master Emerald...
I have to restore them to \nwhere they belong.
It's still incomplete!
I need to find the remaining pieces.
Wherever they are.
Hey look!   \nIt's Eggman's flying fortress.
That's where the rest of \nthe pieces must be.
But I don't know where \nthat ship is.
Hey!   Isn't that \none of Eggman's robots?
I know... I'll follow it\nback to Eggman's base!
Here I come, Eggman!
