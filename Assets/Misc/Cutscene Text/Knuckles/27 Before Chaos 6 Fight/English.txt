Aarghh!   Not again...\nI hate you!
Hey, Sonic!
There you are, Knuckles. \nAbout time!
I will return!
Eggman!   Come back!
I'd better let Sonic handle it from here.
He'll do okay.
Now... I must return to \nAngel Island and the Master Emerald.
No!  It can't be!
I guess he didn't get enough\nthe first time!
You can't stop me from \nrestoring the Master Emerald!
