As far back as I can remember,
I've been living here, \non this dark island...
Always guarding \nthe Master Emerald
from anything \nthat could harm it.
I don't know \nwhy I was given this job...
Why it was my fate...
Destined to be here...\nforever!
What the...?
What's going on here?
Oh no!
Something's happened to\nthe Master Emerald!
Huh?   Who are you?
Did you do this?   \nOhhh, I'll get you for this!
Ooomph!
Ugh agh! Hey, no fair!
Wait!
What's happening to you?\nCome back here!
Wow!   That was incredible!\nI've never seen anything like it.
Oh no!   \nIt's starting to happen.
Without the Master Emerald's \npower,
this whole island will \nfall into the ocean!
