Eggman!   Give me back\nthe Master Emerald!
Knu... Knuckles!
Uhhh, this isn't \nwhat you're after!
Huh, you're right!
That's okay, though.  I can use you\nas a guinea pig to test it.
Chaos!   Chaos!
	Chaos?
It's that creature again!
The same one I saw on \nmy island.
He was there when \nthe Master Emerald shattered,
I'm sure of it.
He saved me the trouble of \nlooking for him.
Now I'll get him good!
Ha ha ha ha ha!   \nWay to go, Chaos!
Hah! Changing shape won't\nscare me!
Fine!   \nGive it your best shot!
