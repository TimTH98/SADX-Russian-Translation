Well, well, well...\nIf it isn't Sonic and Tails!
It's Eggman!
Silence!
I am Dr. Robotnik,
the most cunning scientific\ngenius in the world.
Yeah right, Dr. Eggman!
Enough!  I've been \nworking on a master plan,
but now it's time to \nput it to work!
That usually means trouble,\ncoming from you.
Don't even try to \ninterfere this time.
Give me that Chaos Emerald,\nor else!
Or else, what?   Huh?
Or else I'll take it \nfrom you... the hard way!
