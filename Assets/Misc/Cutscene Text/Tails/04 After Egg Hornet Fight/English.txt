That was just too easy!
Gotcha!  
Hey!   He snagged it!
Chaos could use a little snack!
Who's Chaos?
That's the monster \nI saw the other day.
Uh, Monster?
Yes, yes, yes!   \nIt's really happening! 
Just as the stone tablets \nsaid it would!
Ha ha ha ha!  \nHear this, Sonic!
Chaos' strength increases every time\nI give him a Chaos Emerald.
All he needs is 7 Emeralds\nto become invincible!
Then he will turn Station Square\ninto rubble.
Upon which I will build \nthe ultimate city, Robotnikland!
Ha ha ha ha!  \nYou ready, Chaos?
Let's go find the next Emerald.\nCome on!
Thank goodness they're gone.\nGood riddance!
We can't let that monster get\nany bigger. It could get ugly!
You're right, \nChaos must be stopped!
And he can be if we keep him\naway from more Emeralds, right?
So what do you say, Sonic?
Let's find the Chaos Emeralds \nbefore Eggman does!
