That's Eggman!  I wonder\nwhat happened to Sonic? 
I'm finished!
Chaos was defeated, and now \nmy Egg Carrier is ruined!
No matter!   I will destroy\nStation Square anyway!
If that missile is launched...
Ready?   Fire!
Aah!  No!   It was a dud!
I can't believe this!
Ah!  I'll go and deal \nwith this myself!    
Oh, no!
I'd better get to that missile\nbefore he detonates it!
