Ha ha ha ha!  \nIf it isn't Sonic!
Look!   \nIt's a giant talking egg!
Silence!

the greatest scientific genius \nin the world!
Whatever you say, Eggman!
Enough!  I've got big plans, and\nnow I'm gonna put them to work!
You're always up to no good.\nNow what d'ya want?
I want all of the Chaos Emeralds.
