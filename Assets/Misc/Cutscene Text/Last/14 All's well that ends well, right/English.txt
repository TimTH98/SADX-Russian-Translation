Chaos has changed again.\nThis time for the better.
Yeah!  Super Sonic must have \nneutralized it, so it's nice again.
These are the Chao \nyou were protecting.
They stayed alive for generations\nand now live peacefully with humans.
The fighting's over.\nHarmony's restored, and life goes on.
Thank you so much!
All's well that ends well, right?
Sonic?
