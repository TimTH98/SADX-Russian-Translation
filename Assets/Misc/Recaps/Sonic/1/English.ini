Sonic the Hedgehog!\n	I'd just returned to town\n	after a long journey...\n	Suddenly, this liquid monster attacked me!\n	I had no trouble defeating it, though.\n	Then, while I was lounging by the pool,\n	I saw Tails' plane fly by, trailing smoke!\n	Then it fell from the sky, and\n	crashed near the seashore!\n\n	I've gotta go save Tails right away!!
