Text=	I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!\n	I ran across the Emerald Coast\n	and found Tails,\n	whom I haven't seen for a while.\n	He had a great idea about creating\n	something using a Chaos Emerald.\n	He just loves making machines!\n	What?\n	He has a workshop in Mystic Ruins?\n	OK, I'll go visit it if you want me to.
