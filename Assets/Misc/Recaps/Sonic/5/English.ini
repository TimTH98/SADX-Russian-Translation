Text=	I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!\n	Just when I'd found another Chaos Emerald\n	in Casinopolis, suddenly Eggman\n	showed up!\n	He robbed me of the Emerald and\n	then disappeared.\n	He has 2 and I have 1. He may have the\n	advantage now, but I'll never give up!\n	I'll return to Mystic Ruins\n	to search once again.
