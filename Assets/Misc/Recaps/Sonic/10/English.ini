Text=	I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!\n	Oh no, it's Amy!\n	Why did I have to run into her now?\n	Wherever I go, danger seems to follow.\n	She doesn't seem to care\n	about that, though.\n	She follows me anywhere I go.\n	So I have to protect her...\n	A bird? A bodyguard?\n	Well, now that I can handle, but...\n	Hmmm... I wonder if she is involved\n	in any trouble again??
